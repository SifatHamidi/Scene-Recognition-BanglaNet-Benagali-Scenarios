The emergence of Artificial Intelligence on every aspect of our life is beginning to be more evident
in the developed countries. Scene recognition is the way to next step of this revolution. As the
machine learn to percept what the human eyes can see it can be used for advanced and complicated
tasks. But to do this, we need more data and work. As the scenes themselves can vary from country
to country we need more data on our country’s scenes and objects to jumpstart this revolution.

 The use of the cloud platform “Google Colaboratory” enhanced the efficiency
of the system by cutting down run time and removed the barrier of lower-end GPUs. Recent models
with residual, parallel, and bottleneck layers had shown better performance than traditional models
like VGG and AlexNet.
